Position Status: <strong>Closed/Filled</strong><br>
Salary Range: <strong>$50k-$70k</strong><br>
Location: <strong>Minneapolis / St. Paul MN metro region, USA</strong><br>

<p>ISRG has changed the Internet for nearly everyone using it, with just 17 people. You’d be the 18th, joining a highly motivated and future-focused organization. We make the Internet more secure and privacy-respecting. Our largest project, Let’s Encrypt, helps more than 260 million websites protect their visitors. We operate as a nonprofit so we can stay focused on what’s best for the people using the Internet. This model lets us take on tough problems and we’ve built up the staff capability to do it. We’ve gained the support of the world’s leading companies and funders, like Amazon, Mozilla, Google, and the Ford Foundation.</p>

<p>Our annual operating budget is approximately $5M and growing as we take on new projects.</p>

<p>Until now our accounting and financial management systems have been contracted out. We are in the process of bringing those systems in house due to our growth and the increasing complexity of our financial management needs. We are excited to have full-time finance staff that deeply understand our organization and can provide support to ISRG leadership.</p>

<p>We are a systems-building organization at heart. We have a reputation for building systems that are well-designed, reliable, and efficient.  We are looking for a finance manager who will do the same with our financial management systems - we don’t want something that just works, we want it to work really well.  We are seeking someone who can approach work with a  “yes” mindset and look for creative ways to establish great processes, especially when it comes to ensuring our donors have a trouble-free experience.   If you’re excited about the opportunity to work with our CFO to create and maintain excellent financial management processes, this might be the job for you!</p>

<p>We’d like you to bring the following knowledge and experience to the team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Excellent communication, organization, and prioritization skills</li>
  <li>Nonprofit accounting rules and best practices</li>
  <li>High level of accuracy, attention to detail</li>
  <li>Grant management, including government grants</li>
  <li>Maintaining amortization, depreciation, and prepaid schedules</li>
  <li>Monthly and annual reconciliation of balance sheet and bank accounts</li>
  <li>Purchasing and employee expense management</li>
  <li>Annual audit/990 prep assistance</li>
  <li>Accounts Payable (AP) management, including 1099 and international contractors</li>
  <li>Accounts Receivable (AR) management, including in-kind donations</li>
  <li>Journal entries/allocations to multiple projects</li>
</ul>

<p>We’d appreciate experience with the following, but it is not required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sage Intacct</li>
  <li>Expensify and Bill.com</li>
  <li>Integrating accounting and CRM systems (we use Salesforce)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a priority for us to represent the diversity of the billions of people who use the Internet for their lives and work. We want to understand how to make security and privacy more accessible to everyone, and we value different perspectives and experiences. We strongly encourage people from under-represented communities to apply to help us make the Internet better!</p>

<h3>Location and Benefits</h3>

<p>This job will be located in the Minneapolis / St. Paul MN metro region, but you will work remotely in a home office (permanently, this will not change post COVID-19). Our team has always been entirely remote and our processes and infrastructure are built around that. We will help you get your home office in good shape, including reimbursing internet and phone expenses. When it is safe for us to do so, we will meet in person.</p>

<p>Other benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, and flexible time off and parental leave policies.</p>

<h3>Applying</h3>

<p>To apply, please submit your resume to: <a href="mailto:careers@letsencrypt.org">careers@letsencrypt.org</a></p>

<p>ISRG is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, orientation, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic. We celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive workplace for everyone.</p>
