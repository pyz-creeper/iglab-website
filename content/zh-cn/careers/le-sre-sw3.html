    <p>We’re making HTTPS easier for developers to use, we’re doing it at scale, and we need your help. We’re a first-of-our-kind Certificate Authority (CA). We make certificates available to anyone, for free, and we offer an API to do it. This means more people can enable HTTPS on their websites, with less work. That protects everyone’s web traffic from snoops, and makes us all safer.</p>

    <p>We’re looking for an additional software engineer for our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. Maybe that’s you! Here's what our SRE team does:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We develop software that improves automation and security in our infrastructure.</li>
      <li>We contribute code to ISRG's core applications. (e.g. Let's Encrypt).</li>

      <li>We contribute to open source projects we depend on.</li>
      <li>We help design policies and procedures for both the certificate authority and the organization.</li>
      <li>We participate in an on call rotation. We value protecting our teammates from burnout and accommodate people's schedules as needed.</li>
      <li>We are committed to improving ourselves and the services we provide. We teach each other and learn from our mistakes, often through blameless post-mortems.</li>
      <li>We help run a community forum where developers and end users find solutions to problems they might have with our services. We moderate comments to ensure everything stays on-track. We are happy to say ours is the friendliest and most supportive HTTPS-related forum around.</li>
      <li>We help research potential new projects that ISRG may operate.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>Ability to prioritize and maintain cognizanse of your priorities in your work.</li>
      <li>Excellent written, verbal, and collaborative communication skills.</li>
      <li>Reliable time and task management.</li>
    </ul>
