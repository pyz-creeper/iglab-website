<p>ISRG is an organization dedicated to making the internet more secure and privacy-respecting through technology. Our largest project is Let’s Encrypt, a first-of-our-kind Certificate Authority (CA). We make TLS/SSL certificates available to anyone, for free, and we offer an API to do it. This means more people can easily enable HTTPS on their websites. That protects everyone’s web traffic from snoops, and makes us all safer.</p>

<p>We are developing additional projects that will make meaningful improvements to the threshold of acceptable security and privacy for people using the internet worldwide. We are looking for an additional person to help us meet our fundraising and communications goals as we grow.</p>

<p>It is a priority for us to represent the diversity of the billions of people who use the internet for their lives and work. We want to understand how to make security and privacy more accessible to everyone, and we value different perspectives and experiences. We strongly encourage people from under-represented communities to apply to help us make the internet better!</p>
