  ISRG is a nonprofit with a mission to reduce financial, technological, and educational barriers to secure communication over the Internet. We do this mainly by running public benefit services such as our free and open certificate authority, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letâ€™s Encrypt</a>, and our privacy respecting metrics service, <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/divviup/">Divvi Up</a>.
</p>

<p>
  At ISRG, the traditional role of an engineering manager is split into two roles. Each of our engineers has a technical lead who is responsible for technical decisions, prioritization, and the assigning of work to engineers. Each engineer also has a people manager who is responsible for:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensuring that staff have an excellent quality of life at work.</li>
  <li>Offering career growth guidance and assistance.</li>
  <li>Communicating HR information and facilitating interactions with HR.</li>
  <li>Managing hiring processes to bring on additional staff.</li>
  <li>Contributing to building and maintaining organizational policies related to hiring, onboarding, and staff wellness.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  We are hiring a people manager. You will initially have between 6 and 8 direct reports. The number of direct reports you manage may change over time as our organization evolves and we grow our understanding of what works best.
</p>

<p>
  Here's what we'd like you to bring to the team:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software engineering education or experience that allows you to understand and follow relevant issues and discussions. You will not be performing software engineering work or making technical decisions, but you will need to be able to understand what your reports are doing.</li>
  <li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li>
  <li>A communication style that embraces kindness, compassion, and clarity.</li>
  <li>The ability to have difficult conversations when necessary.</li>
  <li>Strong organizational skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Experience with HR and/or people operations would be appreciated but is not required.
</p>

<h3>Location and Benefits</h3>

<p>
  You can be located anywhere in the contiguous 48 states of the United States.
</p>

<p>
  Our team has always been entirely remote and our processes and infrastructure are built around that. We will help you get your home office in good shape, including reimbursing internet and phone expenses. Other benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, and flexible time off and parental leave policies.
