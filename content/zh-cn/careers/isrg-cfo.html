Posted: <strong>February 12, 2021</strong><br>
Position Status: <strong>Closed / Filled</strong><br>
Salary Range: <strong>$120k-$150k</strong><br>
Location: <strong>Remote within the United States</strong><br>
</p>

<p>ISRG has changed the Internet for nearly everyone using it, with just 15 people. You’d be the 16th, joining a highly motivated and future-focused organization. We make the Internet more secure and privacy-respecting. Our largest project, Let’s Encrypt, helps more than 240 million websites protect their visitors. We operate as a nonprofit so we can stay focused on what’s best for the people using the Internet. This model lets us take on tough problems and we’ve built up the staff capability to do it. We’ve gained the support of the world’s leading companies and funders, like Amazon, Mozilla, Google, and the Ford Foundation.</p>

<p>Our annual operating budget is approximately $5M and growing as we take on new projects.</p>

<p>Until now our accounting and financial management systems have been contracted out. We plan to bring those systems in house due to our growth and the increasing complexity of our financial management needs. We are also looking forward to having full-time finance staff that deeply understand our organization and can be strategic partners with ISRG leadership.</p>

<p>We are a systems-building organization at heart. We have a reputation for building systems that are well-designed, reliable, and efficient. We are looking for a leader who will do the same with our financial management systems - we don’t want something that just works, we want it to work <i>really well</i>. If you’re excited about the opportunity to design <i>excellent</i> financial management and reporting systems, this might be the job for you!</p>

<p>We’d like you to bring the following knowledge and experience to the team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building and managing accounting systems</li>
  <li>Managing banking and cash management systems</li>
  <li>Purchasing and employee expense management</li>
  <li>Audit management</li>
  <li>Accounts Payable (AP)</li>
  <li>Accounts Receivable (AR), including collections</li>
  <li>Tracking and “firewalling” finances for multiple projects</li>
  <li>Reporting and forecasting</li>
</ul>

<p>We’d appreciate experience with the following, but it is not required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nonprofit accounting and tax filings (Form 990 and annual state filings)</li>
  <li>Sage Intacct</li>
  <li>Expensify and Bill.com</li>
  <li>Integrating accounting and CRM systems (we use Salesforce)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a priority for us to represent the diversity of the billions of people who use the Internet for their lives and work. We want to understand how to make security and privacy more accessible to everyone, and we value different perspectives and experiences. We strongly encourage people from under-represented communities to apply to help us make the Internet better!</p>

<h3>Location and Benefits</h3>

<p>This job will be located in the Minneapolis / St. Paul MN metro region, but you will work remotely in a home office (permanently, this will not change once COVID-19 is under control). Our team has always been entirely remote and our processes and infrastructure are built around that. We will help you get your home office in good shape, including reimbursing internet and phone expenses. When it is safe for us to do so, we will meet weekly in person.</p>

<p>Other benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, and flexible time off and parental leave policies.</p>

<h3>Applying</h3>

<p>To apply, please submit your resume to: <a href="mailto:careers@letsencrypt.org">careers@letsencrypt.org</a></p>

<p>ISRG is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, orientation, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic. We celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive workplace for everyone.</p>
