abstract: "Collaborative edge computing (CEC) is a 
novel extension for several edge paradigms 
(e.g., mobile edge computing, fog computing, 
and cloudlet) to further enhance processing 
capabilities to support computation-intensive 
and latency-sensitive applications in edge-centric 
networks. While existing schemes keep adding 
new functionalities (e.g., collaborative computing 
and caching), they overlook an important issue 
of establishing trustworthiness among all CEC 
participants. In general, due to the heterogeneity of all participants, simply assuming trustworthiness among them is undesirable. To address 
this issue, in this article, we present BlockEdge, 
a blockchain-powered framework that delivers 
trusted CEC services. Toward this end, BlockEdge 
first introduces incentive schemes to attract edge 
nodes to participate in CEC tasks. Then it publicly 
and persistently stores all task results on blockchain to enable smart-contract-based correctness 
verification and automated punishment in case 
of failures. Such a built-in accountability scheme 
allows BlockEdge to establish a trust reputation 
system for all CEC stakeholders, which can be 
further used for reliable selection of CEC participators. Our security analysis and experimental 
evaluation demonstrate that BlockEdge is both 
technically feasible and financially beneficial. We 
hope that the blockchain-based trustworthiness 
establishment designed in BlockEdge can provide a fundamental primitive for building a more 
secure collaborative ecosystem, especially for 
complex networks such as 5G and IoT."
