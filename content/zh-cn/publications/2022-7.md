abstract: "Internet content providers often deliver content through bandwidth bottlenecks that are out of their control. Thus, despite often
having massively over-provisioned upstream servers, the content
providers still cannot control the end-to-end user experience. This
paper explores remote traffic shaping, allowing the content provider
to allocate its share of a remote bottleneck link across its users using
a metric other than TCP fairness, while remaining TCP-friendly to
cross traffic on the bottleneck link. To evaluate this approach, we
designed FlowTele, the first system that shapes outbound traffic on
an Internet-scale network to optimize provider-selected metrics,
using source control with neither in-network support nor special
client support. Our extensive evaluations over the Internet show
that by strategically reallocating bandwidth among provider-owned
co-bottlenecked flows, FlowTele improves the provider's total revenue by roughly 20%-30% in various network settings, compared
with both (i) status quo TCP fairshare and (ii) recent practice by
content providers that proactively throttles video quality during
the COVID-19 pandemic, while being TCP-friendly to cross-traffic.
Besides revenue, we also study other metrics, such as QoE fairness,
that a content provider may wish to optimize using FlowTele.
