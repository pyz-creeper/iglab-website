abstract: "Internet of Things (IoT) devices achieve the rapid
development and have been widely deployed recently. Meanwhile,
inherent vulnerabilities of IoT systems (including firmware and
software) have been continually uncovered and thus the systems
are always exposed to various attacks. The root cause of the issue
is that IoT systems always have design flaws and implementation
bugs. In particular, the released systems (e.g., by third-party
marketplaces and IoT vendors) may be maliciously repackaged
with malware. Unfortunately, IoT consumers are not able to
effectively capture such vulnerabilities because of the limited
detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose SmartCrowd, a
blockchain-based platform that aims to outsource security detection of IoT systems to distributed detectors with strong detection
incentives. SmartCrowd enables built-in accountability for IoT
providers and authoritative references of detection results for
IoT consumers. By building smart contracts, we can incentivize
the efficient and high-coverage security detection of IoT systems,
while providing decentralized and automated incentives for both
IoT providers releasing secure IoT systems and detectors uncovering vulnerabilities. We present the security and theoretical
analysis that demonstrates the security of SmartCrowd and the
incentives for participators. We prototype SmartCrowd by using
Ethereum and the experimental results show that SmartCrowd
has both technical feasibility and financial benefits, which can be
applied to build a secure IoT ecosystem."
