abstract: "Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across
different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols
mostly focus on atomic token exchange between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed
ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just
token exchange. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first
platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across
heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that
allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography
protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains.
We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000
lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiment results
show that (i) HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order
of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously
incorporate additional production blockchains."
