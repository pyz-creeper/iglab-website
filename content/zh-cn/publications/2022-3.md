abstract: "Causality analysis on system auditing data has emerged
as an important solution for attack investigation. Given a
POI (Point-Of-Interest) event (e.g., an alert fired on a suspicious file creation), causality analysis constructs a dependency graph, in which nodes represent system entities (e.g.,
processes and files) and edges represent dependencies among
entities, to reveal the attack sequence. However, causality
analysis often produces a huge graph (> 100,000 edges) that
is hard for security analysts to inspect. From the dependency
graphs of various attacks, we observe that (1) dependencies
that are highly related to the POI event often exhibit a different set of properties (e.g., data flow and time) from the less-relevant dependencies; (2) the POI event is often related to a
few attack entries (e.g., downloading a file). Based on these
insights, we propose DEPIMPACT, a framework that identifies
the critical component of a dependency graph (i.e., a subgraph) by (1) assigning discriminative dependency weights to
edges to distinguish critical edges that represent the attack
sequence from less-important dependencies, (2) propagating
dependency impacts backward from the POI event to entry
points, and (3) performing forward causality analysis from the
top-ranked entry nodes based on their dependency impacts
to filter out edges that are not found in the forward causality
analysis. Our evaluations on the 150 million real system auditing events of real attacks and the DARPA TC dataset show
that DEPIMPACT can significantly reduce the large dependency graphs (∼ 1,000,000 edges) to a small graph (∼ 234
edges), which is 4611× smaller. The comparison with the
other state-of-the-art causality analysis techniques shows that
DEPIMPACT is 106× more effective in reducing the dependency graphs while preserving the attack sequences."
