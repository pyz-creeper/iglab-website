abstract: "â€” Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables
users to search over encrypted documents in untrusted clouds
without leaking the search keywords to the clouds. Existing
SSE schemes achieve high search efficiency at the expense of
leaking access patterns and search patterns, where clouds can
recover a large percentage of queried keywords using the leaked
access patterns and search patterns. To prevent clouds from
recovering users' keywords, researchers have proposed a number
of solutions to protect either search patterns or access patterns.
However, none of them can protect both access patterns and
search patterns. Moreover, existing SSE schemes cannot work in
the generic database setting that allows multiple users to write
or read over encrypted documents. In this paper, we propose an
efficient searchable symmetric encryption scheme, called SAPSSE, which protects both access patterns and search patterns in
the generic database setting. The main idea of protecting search
patterns is to leverage re-encryption cryptosystems to shuffle
index entries over multiple clouds. To protect access patterns,
we distribute secure indexes to multiple clouds and then propose
an index redistribution protocol that allows users to renew index
entries in clouds. Furthermore, SAP-SSE provides a configurable
security policy to balance security and efficiency. Formal security
analysis and experimental evaluation show that SAP-SSE can
prevent pattern leakage with low overhead."
