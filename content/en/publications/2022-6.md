abstract: "Nowadays real-time embedded devices are becoming one
main target of cyber attacks. A huge number of embedded
devices equipped with outdated firmware are subject to various vulnerabilities, but they cannot be timely patched due
to two main reasons. First, it is difficult for vendors who
have various types of fragmented devices to generate patches
for each type of device. Second, it is challenging to deploy
patches on many embedded devices without restarting or halting real-time tasks, hindering the patch installation on devices
(e.g., industrial control devices) that have high availability
requirements. In this paper, we present RapidPatch, a new
hotpatching framework to facilitate patch propagation by installing generic patches without disrupting other tasks running on heterogeneous embedded devices. RapidPatch allows
RTOS developers to directly release common patches for all
downstream devices so that device maintainers can easily
generate device-specific patches for different firmware. We
utilize eBPF virtual machines to execute patches on resource-constrained embedded devices and develop three hotpatching
strategies to support hotpatching for all major microcontroller
(MCU) architectures. In particular, we propose two types of
eBPF patches for different types of vulnerabilities and develop
an eBPF patch verifier to ensure patch safety. We evaluate
RapidPatch with major CVEs on four major RTOSes running
on different embedded devices. We find that over 90% vulnerabilities can be hotpatched via RapidPatch. Our system can
work on devices with 64 KB or more memory and 64 MHz
MCU frequency. The average patch delay is less than 8 Âµs
and the overall latency overhead is less than 0.6%.
