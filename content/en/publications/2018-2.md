abstract: "Today's cloud networks are shared among many tenants. Bandwidth guarantees and work conservation are two key properties to ensure predictable performance for tenant applications and high
network utilization for providers. Despite significant efforts, very
little prior work can really achieve both properties simultaneously
even some of them claimed so.
In this paper, we present QShare, an in-network based solution
to achieve bandwidth guarantees and work conservation simultaneously. QShare leverages weighted fair queuing on commodity
switches to slice network bandwidth for tenants, and solves the
challenge of queue scarcity through balanced tenant placement and
dynamic tenant-queue binding. QShare is readily implementable
with existing switching chips. We have implemented a QShare
prototype and evaluated it via both testbed experiments and simulations. Our results show that QShare ensures bandwidth guarantees while driving network utilization to over 91% even under
unpredictable traffic demands."
