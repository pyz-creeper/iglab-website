abstarct: "Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are among the most common distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks today. Despite considerable
effort made by both research and industry, our recent interviews
with over 100 potential DDoS victims in over 10 industry segments indicate that today's DDoS prevention is far from perfect.
On one hand, few academical proposals have ever been deployed
in the Internet; on the other hand, solutions offered by existing
DDoS prevention vendors are not silver bullet to defend against
the entire attack spectrum. Guided by such large-scale study of
today's DDoS defense, in this paper, we present MiddlePolice,
the first readily deployable and proactive DDoS prevention
mechanism. We carefully architect MiddlePolice such that it
requires no changes from both the Internet core and the network
stack of clients, yielding instant deployability in the current
Internet architecture. Further, relying on our novel capability
feedback mechanism, MiddlePolice is able to enforce destination-driven traffic control so that it guarantees to deliver victim-desired traffic regardless of the attacker strategies. We implement
a prototype of MiddlePolice and demonstrate its feasibility via
extensive evaluations in the Internet, hardware testbed, and
large-scale simulations."
