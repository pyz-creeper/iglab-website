abstract: "Web3.0, often cited to drastically shape our lives, is ubiquitous. However, few literatures have discussed the crucial
differentiators that separate Web3.0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain
infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for
Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of Web3.0, and
meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for
Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and
an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for Web3.0
applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable Web3.0, in this paper, we present a design for the third
enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers
interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. HyperService is powered by two
innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified
programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on
blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability
and scalability"
