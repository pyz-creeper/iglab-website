abstract: "Automated management of a physical networkâ€™s lifecycle is
critical for large networks. At Google, we manage network
design, construction, evolution, and management via multiple
automated systems. In our experience, one of the primary
challenges is to reliably and efficiently manage change in
this domain - additions of new hardware and connectivity,
planning and sequencing of topology mutations, introduction
of new architectures, new software systems and fixes to old
ones, etc.
We especially have learned the importance of supporting
multiple kinds of change in parallel without conflicts or mistakes (which cause outages) while also maintaining parallelism between different teams and between different processes. We now know that this requires automated support.
This paper describes some of our network lifecycle goals,
the automation we have developed to meet those goals, and
the change-management challenges we encountered. We then
discuss in detail our approaches to several specific kinds of
change management: (1) managing conflicts between multiple operations on the same network; (2) managing conflicts
between operations spanning the boundaries between networks; (3) managing representational changes in the models
that drive our automated systems. These approaches combine both novel software systems and software-engineering
practices."
