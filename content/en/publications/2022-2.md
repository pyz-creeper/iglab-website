abstract: "In Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, a local passive eavesdropper utilizes network flow information to identify which web pages a user is browsing. Previous researchers have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of WF attacks under a strong Single Page Assumption: the network flow extracted by the adversary belongs to a single web page. In reality, the assumption may not hold because users tend to open multiple tabs simultaneously (or within a short period of time) so that their network traffic is mixed. In this article, we propose an automated multi-tab Website Fingerprinting attack that is able to accurately classify websites regardless of the number of simultaneously opened pages. Our design is powered by two innovative designs. First, we develop a split point classification method to dynamically identify the split point between the first page and its subsequent pages. As a result, the network traffic before the split point is solely generated for the first page. Then, we propose a new chunk-based WF classifier to infer the websites based on the initial chunk of clean traffic. For both classifiers, we apply automated feature selection to select a concise yet representative feature set. We implement a prototype of our design and perform extensive evaluations using SSH and Tor-based datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of both our system components individually and the integrated system as a whole."
