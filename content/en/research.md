### Ongoing Research Projects

<br />

<div class="rblock">

#### <b>Next-Generation Networking Infrastructures</b>


<div class="largefont">

  * Intelligent Network DataPlane (INDP): embrace the flexibility of programmable dataplane (e.g.,  programmable switches, SmartNICs, and host networking) to execute application-desired and data-driven traffic shaping/analysis logic, while imposing negligible overhead in network data-plane. 

  * Evolving the control-plane, data-plane, and management-plane for production-grade datacenter and WAN networks.  

  * Secure inter domain routing in the Internet.

    <br />

<div class="rblock">

#### <b>Privacy Computing</b>


<div class="largefont">

  * Our team is fully committed to privacy computing, providing solutions to secure private and large-scale data. 

  * We work on various privacy computing techniques, including Federated Learning, Secure Multi-party Computation, Secure Enclaves (i.e., trusted execution environments), Zero-knowledge Proofs, and Differential Privacy systems. 

  * We are building and have built various industry-grade privacy computing systems, such as highly efficient privacy-preserving AI model training (including fine-tuning large models) over encrypted (or secret-shared) data.

#### <b>Blockchain-Assisted Secure Infrastructures</b>


<div class="largefont">
Blockchain is the fundamental infrastructure of the next-generation trust-based Web (the so-called Web3.0).  Web3.0 is often cited to shape every aspect of our lives:

  * Web3.0 or Metaverse.

  * Define and advance the fundamental infrastructure enablers for a trust-based future Internet/Web/Metaverse. 

  * Build transparent and trustworthy computing and ground-breaking Web3.0/Metaverse applications. 

  * Build security and trust systems to empower new Internet architectural innovations and industry IoT systems.

<div class="rblock">

#### <b>Applied ML/AI in Practical Distributed Systems</b>


<div class="largefont">

  * Systems and networks with built-in artificial intelligence.

  * Data-driven security policy design for large-scale and heterogeneous systems. 

  * Systems to empower and secure Machine Learning innovations and applications.
